# Short Reflection 
# How did you implement event handling for user actions?
I implemented event handling using setOnClickListener for the submit button to trigger handleSubmitButtonClick(), and TextWatcher for real-time input validation on both name and age fields, providing instant feedback as users type.

# What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction?
I used comprehensive input validation including empty field checks, regex validation for names, try-catch blocks for age parsing, and range validation (0-120). I provided instant feedback through Toast messages for quick notifications and Snackbar messages for prominent success/error states, along with visual cues like temporary field highlighting that clears automatically. The UI uses a simple ConstraintLayout with clear Bootstrap-style design for better readability.

# What improvements would you add in future versions?
I would add data persistence using SharedPreferences, accessibility features with contentDescription attributes, internationalization support, unit and UI tests for validation flows, and optional enhancements like dark mode toggle and subtle animations.
